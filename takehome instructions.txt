HTTP Integration with GitHub and Twitter

Write a program that polls a GitHub repo, looks for new pull requests, and
tweets a summary of each PR on Twitter. Use programming language of your choice.

Some practical considerations:

- A dummy github repo should be created and API access be enabled

- A dummy twitter account should be created and API access should be enabled

- Getting the PRs via webhook might be impractical (especially considering that
  we should be able to easily run and test your program). Suggestion: the
  program can start up, gather the latest PR's, post them to Twitter, then exit.
  Subsequent runs of the program should pick up PR's that have come in since the
  last time. Alternately, the program can run forever and periodically poll the
  GitHub repo for changes.

Constraints:

Make plain HTTP requests against GitHub and Twitter, i.e., do not use a 3rd
party Github or Twitter SDK.
